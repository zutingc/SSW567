What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 
- I didn't really encounter any challenges. However, I did find it interesting that the footer didn't print since I preceeded it by the test cases.

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
- I thought it was okay. It's a bit ambiguous since it says that you "may want to include a few bugs" but I was able to follow along.

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
- The syntax for uniitest is a little strange but I'll learn more and probably get used to it eventually.

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
- I created unit tests for each branch and therefore covered each statement and return (including the "Invalid" return that results from the bug). All of the lines of code, branches, and statements in  the function classify_triangle() are covered; therefore I can say that the function is covered as well.
